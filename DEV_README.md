# Gradle Tasks
- `gradle build` : builds the project (All testcases must pass)
- `gradle clean` : deletes the build

# Binaries

- U must add the /bin to your `$PATH`
- U can run the binaries based on your OS 
  - `sit` : Linus and Mac
  - `sit.bat` : Windows (Not tested, it should work... or at-least i hope)
