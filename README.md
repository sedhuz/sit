# SIT

Welcome to **SIT**, an attempt to reinvent the `git` because, frankly, I had too much coffee and not enough sense to understand git. So thought, ___"Why not make a new one and make sense of it?"___. Still working on the last bit

`sit` stands for **Simple Information Tracker**, or u can call it **Stupid Information Tracker**. Or, if you’re Done With It All™, just call it ***"Screw IT"*** and move on with your life. 

## What Does SIT Do?

- Working on this...


## Why SIT?

Because the world clearly needed another version control system and somehow you stumbled onto this page. So, why not give it a try?

- Working on this...
- Anyone who’s ever wanted to yell **"SCREW IT!"** at their terminal and actually mean it.


## Installation

1. Clone it `git clone https://github.com/sedhuz/sit.git` (yeah, i see the irony)
2. Run it
3. `sit init`
4. Export the `/bin` to `$PATH` : add this line to your `~/.zshrc` or `~./bashrc`
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/Dev/Projects/Serious/sit-vcs/bin:$PATH"
```

Will it work? I dunno, I’ll check later.


## Usage

- I hope it has atleast `init`, `add`, `commit`
